<h1>Date & time</h1>
<p>Our party will be held in Glossop on 6th June 2026. There will be drop-in drinks at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/DtEAmho2y8iPSxwf8"> our house </a> (4 Thorpe street, SK137RW)from 4pm-7pm and the reception party will be 7pm-late.</p>

<h1>Location</h1>
<p>The reception will be held in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/x9Z9ja2NDPyBAEiV7"> Distant Hills Brewery </a>. This is a 5 minute walk from <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/DtEAmho2y8iPSxwf8"> our house </a>. The reception will be held in the upstairs section of the brewery, so there will be stairs there. Buffet style food will be served from 7pm.</p>
  <p> Parking is limited near our house, there is a <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/AFxA2ZwbJrud6p197"> small car park </a> nearby, otherwise .</p>


<h1>Accommodation</h1>
<p>Glossop is not a very large town, but there is accommodation available through b&bs (e.g. on booking.com) and a Travelodge hotel (~20 min walk from our house).</p>
  <p> Alternatively, Manchester city is 30 mins by train from Glossop (every half hour) and obviously has a lot more accommodation options.</p>


<h1>Dress code</h1>
<p>Dress code is semi-casual. The reception is in a pub, so is pretty chill.</p>

<h1>Gifts</h1>
<p>Please do not give us any gifts. If you wish to give something you can donate to X and Y on our behalf.</p>
