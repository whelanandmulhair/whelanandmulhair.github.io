<h1>Date & time</h1>
<p>Our party will be held in Glossop on 6th June 2026. There will be drop-in drinks at our house from 4pm-7pm and the reception party will be 7pm-late.</p>

<h1>Location</h1>
<p>The reception will be held in [here](https://www.distanthillsbrewing.co.uk/) [Distant Hills Brewery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x9Z9ja2NDPyBAEiV7). This is a 5 minute walk from [our house](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DtEAmho2y8iPSxwf8). The reception will be held in the upstairs section of the brewery, so there will be stairs there. Buffet style food will be served from 7pm.</p>
  <p> Parking is limited near our house, there is a [small car park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AFxA2ZwbJrud6p197) nearby, otherwise .</p>


<h1>Accommodation</h1>
<p>Glossop is not a very large town, but there is accommodation available through b&bs (e.g. on booking.com) and a Travelodge hotel (~20 min walk from our house).</p>
  <p> Alternatively, Manchester city is 30 mins by train from Glossop (every half hour) and obviously has a lot more accommodation options.</p>
