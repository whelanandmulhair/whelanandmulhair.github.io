<h1>Accommodation</h1>
<p>Glossop is not a very large town, but there is accommodation available through b&bs (e.g. on booking.com) and a Travelodge hotel (~20 min walk from our house).</p>
  <p> Alternatively, Manchester city is 30 mins by train from Glossop (every half hour; note last train is 10:52pm) and obviously has a lot more accommodation options.</p>


<h1>Dress code</h1>
<p>Dress code is semi-casual. The reception is in a pub, so is pretty chill.</p>
